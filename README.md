Whitespace Destroy Destroy: your one-stop shop for terminating excess whitespace with extreme prejudice.

---
*NOTE: This bundle will only work with TextMate 2, which is now in alpha.  Don't expect sane results with the current TextMate release.*

----

* Highlight trailing whitespace as an error
* Strip whitespace when file is manually saved
* Strip whitespace and save files when focus is lost
* Strip whitespace and save files when focus is gained

The Syntax Highlighting portion comes from [Mads Hartmann Jensen's Whitespace bundle](http://mads379.github.com/posts/whitespace-tmbundle).  Manual-save behavior was inspired by the excellent [Whitespace Bundle from the good people at Viget Labs](https://github.com/vigetlabs/whitespace-tmbundle).

If you have comments or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.  Please open a GitHub issue or better yet, a pull request.
